# vetero

> The exercise is to build and style a page which displays the [current weather consumed from an API](http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=-32.168841&lon=115.809106&units=metric&appid={key}) using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and TypeScript. Please get the users location from the browser and use that and make it poll the weather api every minute.
> 
> No other rules, it just has to run in the browser (you can specify one browser). Weâ€™ll be looking for React / TypeScript skills, bonus points for styling.
